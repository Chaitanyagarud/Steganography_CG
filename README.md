# Steganography_CG
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of image steganography using Python and OpenCV. The application allows users to hide (encrypt) a secret message inside an image and later retrieve (decrypt) the message using a simple UI built with Tkinter.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Embed a secret message into an image.
- **Decryption**: Extract the hidden message from an image.
- **Passcode Protection**: Secure the hidden message using a passcode.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  
  A simple Tkinter-based UI to facilitate the process of:
  - Uploading a cover image.
  - Entering the secret message and passcode.
  - Encrypting (hiding) the message in the image.
  - Uploading an encrypted image.
  - Decrypting (extracting) the hidden message.
 
## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.13**: The primary programming language.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing (reading, writing, and modifying images).
- **Tkinter & ttk**: For creating the GUI with a dark theme.

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.13 installed.Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
